# LocatorApp

This is an Android app I created to help two people find each other (ideally in crowded places where it's difficult to communicate your location).  The app allows users to register accounts using Firebase, and then they are able to connect with other registered users by selecting them in their contact list.  Once they have done so, an arrow will point towards the user they connected with and a distance will be displayed.
